# OPC-UA Server Mock-Up

This is a mock-up of a PLC OPC-UA Server. It is intended to be used for testing OPC-UA clients.

## Getting Started

### From CLI

To start the server, run it from the command line:

```bash
$ cd <path-to-unarchived-folder>
$ ./Server
```

### From a folder

If you start the binary by double-clicking, probably, it won't find the node set XML file. In that case, you can just
copy the node set file to the location that will be printed by the server. Then, restart the server again.

## Releases

Compiled binaries are available for download from
the [Releases](https://github.com/BIG-MAP/wp4-plc-opcua-prototype/releases) page.
